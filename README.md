# mozaiqu.es logs architecture

This repository is more an archive than an "intented-to-be-used-by-other"
project.

It's a simple setup where `fluentd` is used to send logs to S3 (daily) and a
SQL database (every minute).

Feel free to take what makes sense for your use case (see the included MIT
License).
